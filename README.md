## My Lowes Project

Lowes sponsored hackathon - design an app using their api's in 36 hours.

# Getting Started

We got together as a group and decided on a DIY website app that would allow users to input photos of their projects and make comments on the steps and to classify them with a category (matching Lowes product categories) and with a style (the ten most popular ones). Then the user could view their projects. On the home page (no login required) a list of all the projects in the database would be displayed. If time permits, an ability to add a materials list that would link to the product api that would be clickable and would auto-populate the wish list if the user was logged in and would then show the nearest Lowes store and put a pin on the map.
